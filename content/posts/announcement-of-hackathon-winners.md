Greetings to our innovative community of hackers!

Our Fe hackathon at Devconnect Istanbul has come to an end and we would like to thank everyone who participated. We were very pleased to see such a diverse and creative set of attendees. This was the first time for us to organize a hackathon and we have learned a lot from it.

The hackathon was structured in two tracks and we received **8 submissions for the library** track and **11 submissions for the application track**. We are very happy with the number and quality of the submissions and we hope that you all had fun getting your feet wet with Fe!

We had a jury of 6 people who evaluated the submissions individually and voted independently.

Without further ado, here are the winners of the hackathon:
