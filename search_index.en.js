to our innovative community of hackers!\nOur Fe hackathon at Devconnect Istanbul has come to an end and we would like to thank everyone who participated. We were very pleased to see such a diverse and creative set of attendees. This was the first time for us to organize a hackathon and we have learned a lot from it.\nThe hackathon was structured in two tracks and we received 8 submissions for the library track and 11 submissions for the application track. We are very happy with the number and quality of the submissions and we hope that you all had fun getting your feet wet with Fe!\nWe had a jury of 6 people who evaluated the submissions individually and voted independently.\nWithout further ado, here are the winners of the hackathon:\nLibrary track\n1st place (2.048 ETH): Fixed Point Library\nProject page &amp; Github repo \nThis project introduces a fixed-point number representation and mathematical operations tailored for Fe. It can be used in financial computations, scientific simulations, and data analysis.\n2nd place (1.024 ETH): p256verifier\nProject page &amp; Github repo\nSecp256r1 (a.k.a p256) curve signature verifier which allows for verification of a P256 signature in fe.\n3rd place (0.512 ETH): Account Storage with Efficient Sparse Merkle Trees\nProject page &amp; Github repo\nEfficient Sparse Merkle Trees in Fe! SMTs enable inclusion and exclusion proofs for the entire set of Ethereum addresses!\nApplication track\n1st place (2.048 ETH): Tic tac toe game with FE\nProject page &amp; Github repo\nAn implementation of the classic tic tac toe game in Fe with a Python frontend.\n2nd place (1.024 ETH): Fecret Santa\nProject page &amp; Github repo\nFecret Santa is an onchain Secret Santa event based on a \"chain\": gift a collectible (ERC721 or ERC1155) to the last Santa and you'll be the next to receive a gift!\n3rd place (0.512 ETH): go do it\nProject page &amp; Github repo\nA commitment device to help you achieve your goals.\nThank you!\nWe will be reaching out to the winners individually through taikai to arrange the payment of the prizes.\nWe like to thank everyone who participated in the hackathon as well as everyone involved in the organization of Devconnect Istanbul as well as all the volunteers that made this event possible. 🙏\nIf you have any feedback for us, please come by our Discord and let us know!\n","id":"https://blog.fe-lang.org/posts/announcement-of-hackathon-winners/","title":"Winners of the Fe hackathon at Devconnect Istanbul"},"https://blog.fe-lang.org/posts/beyond-alpha-preparing-fe-for-the-future/":{"body":"Today we like to reflect on our progress and share our plans for the future of Fe. In December 2022 Fe hit the Ethereum mainnet for the very first time with the deployment of our bug bounty contest. Although it was hacked shortly after, no serious issues were revealed. The initial hack was just a sloppy fat-finger-copy-and-paste issue on our end but we invite you to read the inside story from the bounty hunter's perspective because it's such a great read.\n\nI cracked @official_fe 's bountiful code challenge 💸I was beyond impressed by the language and had a wonderful time poring over the codeHere's how it happened - including my thoughts on Fe 🧵— plotchy (@plotchy) December 8, 2022 \n\nIf you've been following our recent updates, you will know that we quickly fixed the issue and restarted the contest and that the ongoing bug bounty contest did not reveal any critical bugs. In fact, the bounty is still up for grabs, go check it out if you're interested.\nThis certainly doesn't mean that Fe is bug-free, quite the contrary, we expect the compiler to still have bugs and we want to invite you to find and report them. It also doesn't mean that it's a polished language yet. We are still missing important features and have to iron out rough edges.\nHowever, it does mean that we are confident enough to drop the -alpha marker from releases, starting with the latest 0.22.0 release. As we've mentioned in the past, dropping the -alpha marker does not imply that the language is stable or feature-complete. It will still take a long way to go before we get anywhere close to that. As we continue to follow semantic versioning our 0.x releases continue to be unstable.\nA bright future\nIn fact, we are currently in the process of rewriting large parts of the Fe compiler. This is necessary because the existing code base is not well suited for the features we want to add in the future. When the current rewrite is finished it will enable more advanced features such as:\n\nEnhanced support for generics (e.g. generic structs, generic traits, multiple trait bounds, etc.)\nImproved trait support (e.g. trait inheritance, trait specialization, etc.)\nConst functions (Functions that can run at compile time rather than at runtime)\nType inference\nFlexible abstraction on ABI encoding/decoding\nSupport for Language Server Protocol (LSP)\n\nAdditionally, we're working to replace Fe's Solidity backend. Fe currently uses YUL as its intermediate language and relies on the Solidity compiler to convert YUL to EVM bytecode. We're developing a native LLVM-inspired backend called Sonatina, which will replace this dependency, allowing for more aggressive optimizations and a streamlined Rust-only compilation process.\nIn conclusion, we're thrilled with the progress Fe has made and are confident that the upcoming improvements will further enhance the language. We invite you to join us in exploring and experimenting with Fe as it continues to mature. Your feedback and contributions are invaluable as we work together to build a robust, feature-rich programming language.\nThank you for your support, and stay tuned for more exciting developments!\n","id":"https://blog.fe-lang.org/posts/beyond-alpha-preparing-fe-for-the-future/","title":"Beyond alpha: Preparing Fe for the future"},"https://blog.fe-lang.org/posts/bountiful-break-things-and-get-paid/":{"body":"UPDATE: This article is kept up to date as we go through multiple rounds of the bug bounty contest. We create short announcement posts as needed but this post remains in charge to explain the general details of the contest\nROUND #2 IS LIVE: Read the announcement.\nToday we are unveiling the bountiful project. It is - to our knowledge - the first Fe code deployed to the Ethereum mainnet. This marks an important milestone for Fe on its road to become a production-ready EVM language.\nIntroducing bountiful\nAs we mentioned before, one of the milestones on Fe's path to production is hosting community bug contests. In this way we want to encourage the community to search for compiler bugs. The bountiful project is our initial effort to do this. Not only did we have a lot of fun trying out our own dogfood, we are also setting an example of how Fe can be used in a real mainnet project.\nHow it works\nAt its core is a registry that lets us register bug bounty challenges. All these challenges have one thing in common, they can only be solved if one of the following conditions is met:\n\na bug in the implementation of the code challenge was found and exploited\na bug in the Fe language itself was found and exploited\n\nTo incentivize people to find these exploits the system lets the exploiter claim a bounty of ETH in a permissionless way. We are starting with a prize money of 3 ETH which is subject to changes in the future.\nAlthough we are mainly interested in discovering compiler bugs, exposing bugs in the implementation of any of the code challenges is also valuable, as these can provide important clues where the language should make it even harder to hide bugs.\nThe challenges\nWhile the system is designed to allow registering an unlimited number of challenges we are starting with 4 different implementations of the popular 15 puzzle. In case you've never played this before, here's a link to a free online version of the game. It's a frame with 16 squares and 15 movable tiles that need to be brought in order. What's interesting about this game is that there are certain game states that are impossible to solve. The games that we have deployed all start from such an unsolvable game state. That means that one can only win the game by exploiting a bug either in the implementation of the game or in the Fe language directly. For instance, imagine a bug that gives us unguarded access to modify the storage space of the game contract in unintended ways. If such a bug exists, someone could bring the game into the winning state essentially through bypassing the rules of the game.\nPlease note that these games were not written for gas efficiency, elegance or conciseness - quite the contrary. We have written them purposefully verbose to maximize the potential of exposing bugs. For the same purpose have we chosen to create multiple implementations of the same game so that we can exercise different approaches and language features.\nFrontrunning prevention\nEthereum is a dark forest which is why we need a front-running prevention mechanism. In short, if it is possible to send a transaction that will make the sender richer (in our case by exploiting a Fe bug and claiming ETH prize money) we can be sure that somewhere there's a bot noticing it who will perform the same transaction faster leaving the honest claimer empty handed.\nTo avoid this we've come up with a very simple front-running prevention mechanism. Here is how it works:\n\nAs a bounty hunter we first try to find an exploit by attacking the contracts locally on our own development machine (more on that later)\nLet's suppose we have found a way to bring the code challenge into its solved state on our own local machine\nTo replicate our success on the actual bug bounty registry and claim the prize we first have to aquire an exclusive lock via registry.lock()\n\nBecause it's fun to look at Fe code, here is how lock is implemented:\npub fn lock(mut self, ctx: Context) {\n    if self.is_locked(ctx) {\n        revert AlreadyLocked()\n    } else if ctx.msg_value() &lt; LOCK_DEPOSIT_IN_WEI {\n        revert InvalidDeposit()\n    } else {\n        self.lock = ClaimLock(\n            claimer:ctx.msg_sender(),\n            valid_until_block: ctx.block_number() + LOCK_PERIOD_IN_BLOCKS\n        )\n    }\n}\n\nThe ctx parameter is automatically provided for public contract functions and is Fe's way to provide access to various EVM features without relying on globals. It also makes it simple to see what kind of capabilities a function has just by looking at its signature while at the same time avoiding the introduction of unnecessary keywords. A function that doesn't take self nor ctx is obviously pure.\nAs we can see, an exclusive lock is provided if no one else currently holds a lock and if the minimum lock deposit is provided as the transaction value. The lock deposit is needed to prevent someone from repetitively acquiring locks to gain more time to find an exploit while simultaneously preventing others to claim the bounty. The lock deposit is paid back together with the actual prize money if a successful claim was made within the granted lock period. If the prize money is not claimed over the duration of the lock period the lock deposit will end up as extra money to grow the jackpot. \n\n\nNow that we have acquired an exclusive lock we have a window of 1000 blocks (roughly 3 hours) to bring any of the challenges into the solved state. Cautious as we are, we will wait a few more blocks before we present the solution.\n\n\nNow it's time to solve one of the challenges, which means we exploit the contract in the same way that we have successfully done before on our local development machine. It is important to point out that no other party can interfere with any of the code challenges because we have obtained an exclusive lock.\n\n\nNext we call registry.claim(address_of_challenge) to claim the prize money. Let's look at the implementation of claim as well.\n\n\npub fn claim(self, mut ctx: Context, challenge: address) {\n    self.validate_owns_lock(ctx, owner: ctx.msg_sender())\n\n    if not self.open_challenges[challenge] {\n        revert InvalidClaim()\n    } else {\n        let puzzle: ISolvable = ISolvable(challenge)\n        if puzzle.is_solved() {\n            ctx.send_value(to: ctx.msg_sender(), wei: ctx.self_balance())\n        } else {\n            revert InvalidClaim()\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nNotice that claim also takes ctx as its second parameter but just like self it doesn't need to be provided by the external caller. Also notice the mut keyword before ctx: Context, that's because mutability is always explicit in Fe. This makes it very easy to see where changes are happening.\nThe first thing claim does is that it validates that the caller owns the lock. It then goes on to validate that the challenge address is indeed a registered challenge. It then goes on to call is_solved() on the challenge and pays out the prize money in case it returns true. In other words, getting is_solved() to return true is what is actually needed to win the money!\n\nProfit! 💸\n\nI'm game! Where do we start?\nSo you want to crack the jackpot? Here's how it really works. We don't expect it to be easy. If someone manages to exploit the contracts they sure know what they are doing. They will know how to approach this and which tools to use. This is to say that we don't have much guidance on how to actually find an exploit (if ever!).\nBut still, here's a basic start\n\n\nFirst, clone the code from GitHub\n\n\nNext, run npx hardhat test\n\n\nThis will execute all tests on all challenges as well as a bunch more tests on the registry directly.\nSome of these tests can give us an idea how to win the game and claim the prize money but keep in mind that these tests start from an easily solvable game state which is not the case for the deployed live contracts.\nA good starting point might be to generate and inspect the bytecode as well as the intermediate representation (in YUL) for any of the challenges via fe build path/to/challenge.fe --emit yul,bytecode.\nIn practice, finding a bug hopefully won't be as easy as calling one of the regular game APIs with regular input. If at all possible it will hopefully require real wizardry.\nAddresses of deployed mainnet contracts\nThese are the addresses of the contracts that were deployed on the Ethereum mainnet. We also provide links to the tagged bountiful code that was used for the deployment. Please note that Etherscan doesn't yet support Fe source code verification which means that there is no code visible for these contracts at Etherscan. If you like to see Fe support on Etherscan, please reach out to them and let them know.\nThe following addresses are out of date because the initial round ended with one of the contracts getting exploited. Read our a short twitter thread explaining what happened.\nFor the up to date addresses please refer to the latest announcement of round #2.\nRegistry contract: 0xcF19640dfB72762d6B75d6AfeEcFb5d54092f768 (source code)\nGame contracts:\n\n15 Puzzle implementation 1: 0x08554F7A7674841053d55f9ACe77D698FD25b99e (source code)\n15 Puzzle implementation 2: 0x8e3C037b9f76DE7E1b094C6b7BEEa6e80dCB3f64 (source code)\n15 Puzzle implementation 3: 0xa48607017E7E79011bb0C6B2cB2a462808015449 (source code)\n15 Puzzle implementation 4: 0x27BD48e8098aAf734005483E2cD4a029F70ADc0D (source code)\n\nFinal words\nCreating a new programming language takes a big effort. In an environment where potentially huge amounts of money rely on the safety of the language we have to be extra cautious before we encourage people to use Fe for the development of serious projects. All the more are we excited to be the first to deploy Fe code to mainnet with real money on the line. If you like Fe to succeed please share the word with colleagues and friends. Also please don't hesitate to file bugs and feature requests or hop in our discord for any feedback and questions.\nGet the Jackpot anon!\n","id":"https://blog.fe-lang.org/posts/bountiful-break-things-and-get-paid/","title":"bountiful: break things and get paid"},"https://blog.fe-lang.org/posts/bountiful-round-2/":{"body":"UPDATE, Feb 13, we've activated two more challenges listed below\nWe are happy to inform that we just activated the second round of our bountiful bug bounty contest. Make sure to read the initial announcement if you aren't yet familar with the project.\nBefore you hack\nBefore you get going, please take a minute to help us gather some feedback about our bug bounty contest through our one minute survey.\nChanges\nAfter the first round got exploited we fixed the (stupid!) bug, made a few smaller tweaks and have now redeployed the whole system.\nWe have also created two more game implementation. but for now we decided against activating these just yet. Instead we decided to let some time pass with the existing code challenges and activate the new ones after enough time passed without someone having managed to find any exploits. We deployed these two extra challenges after one month passed without the existing contracts getting exploited.\nWe have also lowered the lock deposit amount from 1 to 0.1 ETH because that should still be enough for the front running protection scheme to work and at the same time be more inclusive to hackers around the world.\nAddresses of deployed mainnet contracts\nThese are the addresses of the contracts that were deployed on the Ethereum mainnet.

Since then, we've made vast progress and want to give the community a chance to catch up with the recent development.\nThere have been a total of 23 merged Pull Requests by 4 different people and we would like to take the chance to highlight some of the development.\nSay hello to our official logo\n\nAs all Fe development happens entirely in the open, we were fortunate to have designer Daniel Iñiguez show up to offer his help and create this logo for Fe. It is \"Fe\" written in iron blocks.\nConstructors\nFe can now handle constructors with a syntax similar to that of Python. Here is an example:\ncontract Foo:\n    bar: map&lt;u256, u256&gt;\n\n    pub def __init__(baz: u256, bing: u256):\n        self.bar[42] = baz + bing\n\nImplicit return of ()\nFe now treats functions that do not explicitly return anything the same way that Rust does by implicitly returning () (an empty Tuple). To let code speak; all of these mean the same thing:\nFull length form\ndef foo() -&gt; ():\n    y: u256 = 1\n    return ()\n\nNo explicit return in signature\ndef foo():\n    y: u256 = 1\n    return ()\n\nNo explicit return statement\ndef foo() -&gt; ():\n    y: u256 = 1\n\nNo return in signature and function body\ndef foo():\n    y: u256 = 1\n\nNote that empty tuple literals are not supported yet, so some of the examples will not compile.\nSemantically, this is how Rust treats empty function returns. The reason why we followed suit is because it makes code more straight forward and saves us from having to implement a special type for empty function returns. Functions simply always return something even if this something means it's the () type.\nString and dynamically-sized ABI type support\nSupport for encoding of dynamically-sized arrays was prioritized this month so that we could implement strings, which are used in the ERC-20 contract. Although strings are encoded dynamically, their sizes are capped by the developer. In practice, these sizes look similar to the sizes of numeric types (e.g. u8, u16, .., u256). With strings, though, the size is representative of bytes and is not limited to a set of predefined sizes, meaning the developer can specify any size (e.g. string32 or string5555).\nHere's a piece of working Fe code that shows strings in action:\ncontract Foo:\n    event MyEvent:\n        text: string100\n        amount: u256\n\n    pub def bar(text: string100, amount: u256):\n        emit MyEvent(text, amount)\n\nMiscellaneous features\nThere's a whole bunch of features that weren't yet supported four weeks ago. Without going into too much detail, let's just list them here:\n\nFunction calls (with or without arguments)\nIf / Else statements\nWhile Loops (including break and continue statements)\nBoolean support\nAssert statements\nEvents with multiple parameters\nMany improvements to our ABI encoder\n\nFinal words\nThere's been a lot more development that didn't get mentioned here, but we'd like to keep these updates short and crisp. Maybe just a short teaser, fe.ethereum.org has been set up and currently refers to the generated API docs, but will be replaced by a proper website soon.\n","id":"https://blog.fe-lang.org/posts/development-update-1/","title":"Fe Development Update #1"},"https://blog.fe-lang.org/posts/development-update-2/":{"body":"It's been a month since our last development update and we'd like to take some time once again to fill you in on our progress.\nIn this time, we've merged a total of 20 Pull Requests from 3 different people, finished implementing all the features required for an ERC-20 contract, expanded type support, and have begun planning our first release.\nERC-20 support\nEarlier in October, we set the year-end goal of completing support for all of the features used in a basic ERC-20 contract. We're proud to say that we hit our target about a month earlier than planned. The compiled bytecode is fully tested using rust-evm and appears to work just fine. Keep in mind, though, that the compiler is still experimental, so we do not recommend deploying any tokens to mainnet quite yet.\nMisc new features\n\nSupport for all sizes of signed and unsigned integer types.\nIndexed event parameters.\nAll types may be used as contract fields now. Previously, we only supported maps.\nThe CLI can now emit pretty-printed Yul and JSON ABIs.\nSupport for ternary statements (thanks @satyamakgec).\n\nRelease plan\nWe're looking forward to getting the compiler into people's hands and receiving feedback. Starting mid-January, we'll be cutting binary releases on our Github page every month. With these binaries, you will be able to generate contract ABIs, bytecode, and Yul IR. If you would like Fe and its tooling to accommodate you, please consider downloading a compatible binary and create issues for anything that seems out of place.\nWhat's next\nNow that we've finished support for an ERC-20 contract, we will be turning our focus to a working implementation of the Uniswap V2 protocol. We plan on having this done by April of next year. By focusing on such a widely used platform, we are able to identify desirable features.\nSpecial thanks\nOur project currently has ~80 contract fixtures that are deployed and tested using rust-evm. Being able to reliably test all of these contracts within a fraction of a second has been invaluable to the development process. We'd like to thank @sorpass and other contributors very much for the work they have done on this EVM implementation.\n","id":"https://blog.fe-lang.org/posts/development-update-2/","title":"Fe Development Update #2"},"https://blog.fe-lang.org/posts/development-update-3/":{"body":"Howdy, this is our first development update in 2021. We would once again like to keep you up to date about all the progress that happened since the previous update.\nWe shipped v0.1.0-alpha \"Amethyst\"\nEarlier this year, we landed our first alpha release with binaries for Linux and Mac. If you are as excited about Fe as we are, you might want to grab a binary from here and play with some examples.\nWhat's especially exciting about this release is that it has kicked of a fixed release cycle that we have committed to. From now on, we'll be shipping one release per month.\nJust keep in mind that these are all alpha releases and are not supposed to be used for real world development just yet. Fe still has a long way to go before it can be used in production, but the pace of development is promising.\nMore user-defined types\nWe now support two new type definitions -- structs and contracts. \nStructs\nStructs are a group of named variables in one segment of memory. They help with writing organized and efficient code.\nFor now, Fe only supports structs consisting of base types, this will be changed to include all types in a later version.\nExample usage of a struct:\nstruct House:\n    price: u256\n    size: u256\n    vacant: bool\n\ncontract Foo:\n    pub def bar() -&gt; u256:\n        building: House = House(300, 500, true)\n        assert building.size == 500\n        assert building.price == 300\n        assert building.vacant\n\n        building.vacant = false\n        building.price = 1\n        building.size = 2\n\n        assert building.vacant == false\n        assert building.price == 1\n        assert building.size == 2\n        return building.size\n\n\nUsage of structs in Fe is pretty run-of-the-mill, so we won't go into too much detail describing the code above.\nFurther down the road, we intend to support function definitions on structs.\nContracts\nFe of course already allows you to define contracts, but it wasn't until recently that contracts became types in their own right.\nNow, if a contract definition is in the module scope, it can be used to conveniently deploy, load, and interact with contracts. Below is an example of a contract being loaded and called:\ncontract Foo:\n    event MyEvent:\n        my_num: u256\n        my_addrs: address[5]\n        my_string: string11\n\n    pub def emit_event(\n        my_num: u256, \n        my_addrs: address[5], \n        my_string: string11\n    ):\n        emit MyEvent(my_num, my_addrs, my_string)\n\ncontract FooProxy:\n    pub def call_emit_event(\n        foo_address: address,\n        my_num: u256,\n        my_addrs: address[5],\n        my_string: string11\n    ):\n        foo: Foo = Foo(foo_address)\n        foo.emit_event(my_num, my_addrs, my_string)\n\nHere an address is being cast to an instance of Foo and called using the attributes of foo.\nWe can also create new contracts, like so:\ncontract Foo:\n    pub def get_my_num() -&gt; u256:\n        return 42\n\ncontract FooFactory:\n    pub def create_foo() -&gt; address:\n        # value and salt\n        foo: Foo = Foo.create(0)\n        return address(foo)\n\nIntroducing to_mem() and clone()\nThese two builtin functions have been added for convenience when dealing with reference types. Here we'll explain why they were added and how to use them.\nTo understand what clone() does, consider the following example:\npub def example(my_array: u256[10]):\n    # assign my_array to another reference\n    second_reference: u256[10] = my_array\n\n    # Both variables point to the same section in memory\n    assert my_array[3] == 5\n    assert second_reference[3] == 5\n\n    # Changing the 3rd item in second_reference also affects my_array\n    second_reference[3] = 50\n \n    assert my_array[3] == 50\n    assert second_reference[3] == 50\n\nAs you can see, assigning a reference type to another variable does not copy the underlying data, it only creates a second variable that points to the same place in memory. This may not be what we want, though. We may want two distinct copies of the underlying data. In these situations, we can use clone() to copy the value to a new segment of memory. This is demonstrated in the following example:\npub def example2(my_array: u256[10]):\n    # clone my_array into second_array\n    second_array: u256[10] = my_array.clone()\n\n    # Both variables hold identical data to begin with\n    assert my_array[3] == 5\n    assert second_array[3] == 5\n\n    # But changing the 3rd item in second_array does NOT affect my_array\n    second_array[3] = 50\n \n    assert my_array[3] == 5\n    assert second_array[3] == 50\n\nNow that we understand clone(), let's talk about to_mem() for a minute. In the first example, we said that second_reference: u256[10] = my_array creates a second reference to the same point in memory without copying the underlying data. This only works for reference types in memory, not storage. Consider this other example which won't compile.\npub def example4():\n    # THIS DOES NOT COMPILE\n    second_array: u256[10] = self.my_array\n\nThe reason this code 👆 doesn't compile is because Fe won't let variables hold mutable storage pointers. This is on purpose. State mutation should be explicit in Fe, so we limit the places where state mutation takes place to statements that begin with self (e.g. self.my_array[1] = 1 or self.mutate_me()). If we were to have mutable storage pointers running around in variables, someone could mutate state in a statement like my_array[42] = 26, which can make the contract's behaviour difficult to understand.\nNote: For now, all storage pointers are considered mutable, so the assignment rule described above currently applies to all storage pointers. In future versions of Fe, we will likely add Rust-style variable mutability, making it possible to assign storage pointers (as long as they're immutable).\nThere are of course instances, though, where one would like to assign data found in storage. Since the only assignable pointer location is memory, we must copy values from storage and into memory before assigning them. To accomplish this, we provide the builtin function to_mem(). The to_mem() function is similar to clone(), but is used to copy values that are in storage to memory.\nIn the example below, we demonstrate how to_mem() can be used to pass an array held in storage into a function:\npub def example3():\n    self.my_function(self.my_array.to_mem())\n\nFor more information about how we plan on dealing with pointer locations in Fe, checkout RFC #161.\n\nWhew! This was a lot to unpack. Here are a few more contributions we'd like to mention:\n\nSupport for compiling modules with multiple contracts (See PR#197)\nSupport for many builtin attributes (e.g. block.timestamp, See PR#208)\nCLI output can be overwritten via --overwrite (See PR#206)\nSupport for static strings (e.g val = \"foo\") (See PR#182)\nLots of fixes and type safety improvements\nA number of bugs have been identified by Alex Groce using afl-compiler-fuzzer\n\nIf you like to learn more about these, reading the linked Pull Requests should be a good start.\nWhat's next\nWe continue to work against our current target: Having a working Uniswap demo written in Fe. Building examples of real world Ethereum applications helps us to prioritize important features. If you are interested in tracking our progress you might want to checkout our Uniswap demo milestone on Github.\nSpecial thanks\nWe would like to thank our new contributors Sean Billig, Volodymyr Lykhonis, Satyam Agrawal and Alex Groce who all did amazing work with their issues and pull requests that helped us move Fe forward.\n","id":"https://blog.fe-lang.org/posts/development-update-3/","title":"Fe Development Update #3"},"https://blog.fe-lang.org/posts/development-update-4/":{"body":"Hello, it's time for another Fe development update. There's alot to share since the last one.\nWe shipped v0.2.0-alpha \"Borax\"\nThis release contains many of the improvements mentioned in our last development update. You can find more details on the release page. \nUniswap Demo\nIn December of last year, we set a goal to support the features needed for a basic implementation of the Uniswap-V2 core contracts before April. The features were catalogued in this Github Milestone and tagged with priority levels. We were able to close all high-priority issues and added a test that demonstrates the behaviour of our implementation. In short, we are able to do the following:\n\nDeploy the Uniswap factory contract.\nCreate a new pair using the factory contract.\nAdd liquidity to the pair.\nPerform a swap.\nWithdraw liquidity.\n\nThere are still a few rough edges, though. These are documented in the Uniswap module using TODO comments that link to issues. The remaining issues will be worked on over the next few months, but are not of high priority.\nSafe arithmetic\nOne of Fe's core promises is to perform safe arithmetic operations by default. This is something that you'll find in our next release. Now if the result of an arithmetic operation, such as x + y, exceeds or falls below the upper or lower limit of the type, the transaction reverts. Developers have so far relied on the SafeMath library to perform these kind of safety checks. It's worth pointing out that Fe also checks power operations (i.e. base ** exponent), which the SafeMath library does not check. Fe's integrated arithmetic checks use the same Yul code as Solidity 0.8.0 (Thanks Solidity!).\nIn the future, we will likely add support for a special wrapping type similar to Rust that allows develops to explicitly opt-out from these checks. This is something that may be used to save gas, if you know what you're doing.\nRelated PRs: #265, #267, #271, #312, #313\nMore work on structs\nLast month we shipped basic support for structs. Since then, we've landed some new improvements to our struct support.\n\nAccept structs as parameters to public functions or return them from public functions (#296)\nUpdate individual struct fields in storage (#246)\nRequire keyword syntax to initialize structs (#260)\n\nOther features and bugfixes\n\nPrevent numeric literals from exceeding 256 bits (#247)\nSupport boolean not operator (#264)\nSupport boolean and operator (#270)\nSupport boolean or operator (#270)\nSupportself.address (#270)\nExpose abi_encode function (266)\nSupportmsg.sig (#311)\nFix several cases where conflicting names were not properly handled (#317)\n\nContinued compilation fuzzing\nagroce has continued fuzzing the Fe compiler. Since our last development update, he has found 12 instances where the compiler crashes for some input. These bugs often point to missing checks in the fe-analyzer library. Investigating them is very insightful. Thanks Alex! You can checkout the fuzzer here.\nWhat's next\nHere are a few things we'll be working on over the next few months:\n\nMore checking: Compilation fuzzing has shown us that we need to be checking source code more thoroughly. We'll focus on adding complete checking.\nLowering pass: This makes the compiler more composable and transparent.

Let's dive right in.\nTeam growth\nNot only did we receive a steady flow of external contributions, we've also grown the core Fe team by two new (part-time) software engineers. Say hello to Sean and Satyam who will be helping us on our way to change the EVM language space. Fe is happy to have you 🙏\nPart of their efforts have already formed the latest release that just shipped.\nWe shipped v0.4.0-alpha \"Diamond\"\nWe've actually shipped two releases since the last update but many of the changes from the 0.3.0-alpha release were already covered in our last development update. As usual, the entire list of changes can be found in the changelog on the release page. In this article, we'll focus on the two most exciting recent developments. \nA brand new parser\nNot only does the 0.4.0-alpha release come with a shiny name, it comes with a new, shiny parser, too.\nOur old parser was by far the oldest part of the code base and it had served us well up to this point. Shout out to David who wrote it when he originally started the project under a different name.\nAs we are moving closer to our first non alpha release we've made it a high priority for Fe to have high quality, context-aware error messages. While this may not have been impossible with the old parser, the new handwritten recursive descent parser gives us all the flexibility and clarity that we need to enable great rust style error messages.\nTo give an example, consider this wrongly formatted source code:\ncontract Example:\nval:u8\n\nWhile we can and will tune the quality of our error messages, the following example of an actual Fe error message does already demonstrate the improved user experience that we got out of the parser rewrite so far.\n\nWe currently continue to streamline our error reporting across the different processing stages to take advantage of the improvements on all levels.\nWhile the parser rewrite was mostly motivated by improving our error messages it will also help us to implement new features faster.\nLowering pass\nThe other major improvement that just landed in the latest release is an entirely new compile phase called the \"lowering pass\". Lowering is compiler speak for what is commonly referred to as \"desugaring\".\nIn other words, whenever we say that something is just \"syntactic sugar\" for a longer, less-elegant syntax, it is the lowering pass's job to take that code and turn it into the less-elegant, but simpler syntax. This is a technique that many modern compilers use, including rustc.\nBy using lowering, we are able to simplify the implementation of new features and reduce compiler complexity.\nTuples\nTo give a concrete example, our latest release comes with support for tuples, which can be used like this:\ncontract Foo:\n    pub def bar(my_num: u256, my_bool: bool) -&gt; (u256, bool):\n        return (my_num, my_bool)\n\nFe's new lowering pass rewrites this as follows:\nstruct tuple_u256_bool:\n    item0: u256\n    item1: bool\n\ncontract Foo:\n    pub def bar(my_num: u256, my_bool: bool) -&gt; tuple_u256_bool:\n        return tuple_u256_bool(item0=my_num, item1=my_bool)\n\nAs you can see, Tuples don't actually exist past the lowering stage, as Tuples in Fe are just syntactic sugar over structs (which by the way, is also true for Rust).\nWe also use the lowering pass for augmented assignments (e.g. x += 1) and plan to use it for many of the upcoming features. It's a real game changer, as it helps us to avoid code duplication and reduces the overall maintenance cost for the features we develop.\nOther features and bugfixes\n\nSupport for revert messages in assert statements (#288)\nSupport for augmented assignments (#338)\nReject invalid emit (#211)\nProperly tokenize numeric literals when they start with 0 (#331)\nReject non-string assert reasons as type error (#335)\nReject code that creates a circular dependency when using create or create2 (#362)\n\nWhat's next\nOur plan is to ship our first non-alpha release in 2021 and hence our focus is currently on implementing the essential features that are still missing as well as eleminating bugs and improving the robustness of the compiler which includes building out tooling for differential contract fuzzing.\nWe will soon write a dedicated blog post that will shed more light on our plans for Fe's road to production.\n\nStay tuned for more monthly updates and releases.\n","id":"https://blog.fe-lang.org/posts/development-update-5/","title":"Fe Development Update #5"},"https://blog.fe-lang.org/posts/development-update-6/":{"body":"It's been a month since our last update. In this time, we've merged a total of 22 pull requests from 4 different contributors. Here are some highlights.\nWe shipped v0.5.0-alpha \"Evenkite\"\nThis release contains much of the work we'll cover in this update. You can head over to the release page for more info and downloads.\nGeneric arguments (partially implemented)\nWe've added generic arguments syntax to type descriptions and expressions. This cleans up some existing sore spots in our syntax and prepares us for full-on generic support.\nPreviously, map type arguments (e.g. map&lt;u256, address&gt;) were handled as a special case in the parser. We were also using an ugly syntax for strings (e.g. string42), where the numeric suffix indicated the maximum size of the string. We've now updated the parser to handle generic arguments on all types, so maps are no longer a special case and the max size of strings are expressed using the same syntax as maps (e.g. String&lt;42&gt;). In the case of strings, the generic argument is a const value rather than a type.\nFor now, these are just syntax changes and the underlying type implementations remain the same. In the future, though, we'll be adding support for generic arguments in type definitions. This will enable us to pull the definitions of strings, maps, and other types out of the compiler and into libraries. This will improve the composability of Fe and establish patterns that other developers can use to implement their own types.\nRelevant PRs:\n\nRemove ast::TypeDesc::Map in favor of TypeDesc::Generic #384\nAllow generic arguments in Expr::Call #425\n\nMore expressions\nY-Nak added support for a few more numeric representations.

We believe the Solidity team is doing a great job and are clearly doing a lot of things right to maintain their current market share. However, we also believe that more choices for developers will be a net positive for the ecosystem.\nIntroducing Fe\nWe are excited to announce a new smart contract language for the Ethereum ecosystem named Fe (pronounced \"fee\"). The language was originally born as a rewrite of the Vyper compiler (in Rust) to address issues that were highlighted in the Vyper Security Review by Consensys from another angle.\nWhile the initial goal was to have an alternative Vyper compiler, eventually the languages started to diverge in their syntax and it was decided to make a clean cut with a new name. Fe was born.\n\"Fe\" are the letters for the chemical element iron of the periodic table. Iron conveys a sense of durability, and this reinforces the notion of compiler correctness. Rust forms on iron, which ties the name back to the Rust language that the Fe compiler is written in.\nGoals\nThis project inherits a number of things from Vyper; namely it has a Pythonic syntax and emphasizes language safety. As such, the syntax of Fe is largely inspired by Python. This allows for readable and expressive code that would be familiar to developers who have used Python. Fe also uses static typing and limits dynamic behavior to reduce footguns and improve safety.\nAt this early stage in development the differences between Fe and Vyper are still limited. For now, one will notice that Fe borrows a few syntactic properties from Rust. It's likely that Fe will begin to more closely resemble Rust as we continue to add new features.\nCorrectness of Fe's Implementation\nBeyond the language itself, we are taking steps to ensure that the compiler implementation is correct. In other words, there should be a high degree of confidence that executable code produced by the Fe compiler will behave correctly with respect to the language specification.\nSome of the steps we're taking to ensure correctness are listed below:\nWriting a language specification\nA compiler can not be demonstrated to be correct if there is no specification to check against. For this reason, we have begun writing a specification for the language, which borrows heavily from the Rust reference 🦀❤️. This specification will be written as we implement features. By the time we are ready for an audit, we will be able to produce a comprehensive specification.\nImplementing in Rust\nRust is a systems language with strong safety guarantees. These safety guarantees prevent Rust programs from entering undefined behavior. For example, null pointers are not possible in safe Rust. This makes it so that Rust compiler catches bugs during compile time that would otherwise be encountered during runtime.\nUsing distinct components\nFe aims to separate components of the compiler into distinct libraries that follow standard compiler design guidelines. That is, we have implemented parsing, semantic-analysis, and compilation as separate libraries with their own APIs and tests. This separation of concerns makes it easier to understand the behavior of the compiler.\nTargeting Yul\nThe compiler targets Yul as an intermediate representation. Yul is a project being developed by the Solidity team and is intended to be a common denominator between multiple low level platforms, meaning that we do not need to write separate backends for EVM 1.0, EVM 1.5, and eWASM. Currently, the Solidity compiler provides experimental support for Yul -&gt; EVM 1.0 compilation. For the time being, we are just using the Solidity backend for Yul compilation. This has saved us a significant amount of time.\nStandardizing on YUL as an intermediate language may also prove as an convenient gateway to target Optimistic Rollup environments as recently highlighted by Vitaliks Ethereum Roadmap post.\nProgress\nThe EBNF grammar expected by the parser can be found here. The parser provides support for everything specified in that grammar file and includes comprehensive testing.\nEarlier this year, development started on the compiler pass. We were able to add support for a few simple contracts. Most notably, we were able to compile a simple guestbook contract to functional bytecode.\nIn the past month, development on Fe has ramped up significantly. We are optimistic about adding support for all features used in an ERC20 contract and be able to compile one before the end of 2020. To be clear, the compiler will in no way be a suitable choice for a production ERC20 by that time, but we look forward to demonstrating the capabilities of Fe with such a well understood working example.\nFor the curious, here's a simple contract that is already fully functional today:\ntype BookMsg = bytes[100]\n\ncontract GuestBook:\n    pub guest_book: map&lt;address, BookMsg&gt;\n\n    event Signed:\n        idx book_msg: BookMsg\n\n    pub def sign(book_msg: BookMsg):\n        self.guest_book[msg.sender] = book_msg\n\n        emit Signed(book_msg=book_msg)\n\n    pub def get_msg(addr: address) -&gt; BookMsg:\n        return self.guest_book[addr]\n\nGet in touch\nWe are committed to developing a language that will enrich the Ethereum developer community.

Today we would like to reflect on where Fe currently stands, its path to production, and a possible timeline for it.\n\nFe is still in early stages of development and all of our releases are marked as alpha. This means that the software being provided is only partially complete. For instance, the current release is v0.8.0-alpha \"Haxonite\" and comes with a warning that strongly discourages use beyond just tinkering with the language.\nHaving said that, we feel confident that we can move past this alpha stage and into a beta stage before the end of 2021. In the following section, we will discuss this beta release in further detail and provide a rough idea of where we will go from there.\nDefining our beta release goals\nDevelopment of a programming language is a marathon, as there exist many features to implement and tools to build. Fully realizing our current goals will take a long time, so we would rather not let this hinder the release of a usable compiler. For this reason, we are making an effort to cut a release in the near term that can be used in production safely and practically. We call this our beta release. In this section, we will define what should be expected from this beta release.\nBeta non-goals\nBefore we dive into any specific beta goals, let us give some explicit NON-GOALS. Without further ado, here are the things one should NOT expect from our first beta release.\nFeature stability\nLanguages should strive for a release policy which ensures that code written in the language doesn't need to be re-written every time the compiler is updated. Having said that, Fe is far from guaranteeing such a thing, so the first beta release will not be considered stable. This means that developers should expect breaking changes between beta releases. These changes should appear less-frequently over time, though.\nWe follow semver, so stability will be indicated by our first non-zero major version (i.e. 1.0.0). From this version on, breaking changes may only be included in major updates.\nFeature completeness\nBased on what's written above, one can probably gather that feature completeness is also not a beta goal. We want to emphasize that some important features will be missing, which may hinder development. Be warned!\nHere are some of the features that we are excited about, but won't make it into the first beta release:\n\nSupport for generics over types and constant values\nRust style error handling via Result&lt;V, E&gt;\nTraits for structs and interfaces for contracts\n\nThese features may be included in our first stable release, though.\nOptimal gas efficiency\nIn these early stages of development, we have focused more on delivering features rather than minimizing the amount of gas consumed during runtime. We do get some efficiency gains for free from the Yul optimizer, but there are still some simple optimizations that could be performed in the Yul generation phase that are currently not performed. \nActual beta goals\nNow that we've explained what you shouldn't expect from our first beta release, let's turn to the actual goals.\nCompiler correctness\nSmart contracts created using Fe should behave as expected; in other words, the compiler needs to be implemented correctly. If it is not, development teams will have a hard time justifying the use of Fe in their projects. Here we'll discuss the methods used to validate the correctness of the Fe compiler and how we'll demonstrate to the community that these methods have been effective.\nFirst, let's discuss important aspects of the compiler that need to be correct.\nSource code validation: The compiler should reject any invalid source code.\nCode generation: Code generated by the compiler should have the same meaning as the source code.\nRuntime checks: Values are checked during runtime (e.g. arithmetic overflow, ABI decoding, and array index out of bounds). This is done to prevent undefined runtime behavior.\nTo make reasoning about the compiler and testing it easier, we've separated compilation into multiple phases. These phases are: static analysis, lowering, Yul generation, and bytecode generation.\nBelow, we'll discuss the various methods used to validate the behavior of each phase and the whole compiler.\nSnapshot Testing: insta.rs is used to assess the output of each phase and to guarantee regressions don't go unnoticed.\nIntegration testing: Fe source files are written every time a feature is added and are tested using rust-evm. We also run tests against more complicated contracts, like our UniswapV2 demo.\nRuntime function testing: Yul functions added to the runtime are tested directly on rust-evm.\nCompilation fuzzing: A continuously running service tries to find crashes in the compiler by invoking it with randomly generated Fe source code. This finds nuanced errors in both source validation and code generation. You can find the fuzzer here.\nUnit testing: Simple components are validated with unit tests.\nHaving compilation separated into multiple phases and testing each phase is great, but it alone does not gain trust from the community. In order to do so, the compiler will need to be put to the test. This will of course come naturally with time and use on mainnet, but the initial attempts to find flaws will need to be incentivized. Here are two ways we could incentivize people to find flaws:\n\nHave a security firm audit the codebase.\nHost community bug contests.\n\nCurrently, the plan is to start offering bug bounties before the end of the year. These bounties will be open on certain alpha releases and the objective will be to find severe bugs. If this program does not find any serious vulnerabilities within a given timeframe, we will confidently remove the alpha suffix from new releases and use beta in its stead. \nWhen we arrive at a stable release (1.0.0), we might get the codebase audited. This, however, is probably 1-2 years out.\nIt's also worth mentioning that the Yul IR generated during compilation may be exported and audited on its own. This means that one can verify the behavior of their contract without relying on the Fe compiler.\nDeveloper UX\nWe are currently working with contributors from the Fe community to make sure Fe is supported by popular tools that are used within the Ethereum smart contract developer community.\nWe already have some work in progress candidates for some tooling that we believe will become quite important going forward. Shout out to Marek who's been on fire lately to get these off the ground. 🔥 \n\nfejs - JavaScript bindings for the Fe compiler\nvscode-fe Fe language support for Visual Studio Code\nhardhat-fe Fe support for Ethereum's popular development environment hardhat\n\nWhile all of them are in very early development stages we encourage you to take a look or get involved. We are happy to provide some funding on a per task/project basis for substantial contributions.\nDocumentation &amp; Spec\nWe have been working to fill the gaps in our documentation and language specification. Improvement of these resources will continue, with the goal of fully-specifying the language and making the compiler very accessible. \n\nWhile there is still some uncertainty around the exact timing, we feel reasonably confident in saying that we will deliver a beta release in Q4 of 2021 that meets the expectations laid out in this post.\nWe are excited to see what the community will start building on and around Fe when that happens.\n","id":"https://blog.fe-lang.org/posts/path-to-production/","title":"Fe's path to production"},"https://blog.fe-lang.org/posts/simple-dao-written-in-fe-go-break-it/":{"body":"With devconnect just around the corner, we would like to present another bug bounty opportunity.\nInspired by the original Gnosis Multisig Wallet, we have written a very simple DAO contract in Fe. It can be understood as a weighted multisig wallet where the execution of transactions is determined by a group of members and their voting power measured in governance tokens. To fully understand the concept we recommend to check out the README and the source code.\nWe've deployed an instance of the DAO and its governance token on mainnet, set up members and funded it with some ETH.
